# KH-Image Optimizer

Early scaffold for a Smush-style plugin tailored to KH’s stack.

## Goals

- Automatic image optimization on upload with configurable presets.
- Bulk/batch optimizer with resumable queues and REST endpoints.
- Directory Smush for arbitrary folders with secure file-tree browsing.
- CDN/offload integrations (S3, Cloudflare, etc.).
- Modern admin UI (React/Vite) for quick-setup, notices, and monitoring.

## Status

Planning phase. Only bootstrap file exists. Use this document to track next steps as we flesh out architecture and tooling.
